# GitHub and Markdown

Coders are writers of code and technical documentation. They need to be able to share content and communicate quickly. These tools will help you do that.

- **GitHub** is the #1 cloud platform for storing, sharing, and versioning code. Think of it like Google Drive for developers, with some extra CS-specific features.
- **Markdown** is the language for writing documentation and other CS-related content. This page was [written in Markdown](https://github.com/buckldav/utah-csta/tree/master/docs/github/markdown.md)!

We will dive into Markdown first, which we will use to provide `README.md` files (containing instructions for usage and descriptions of functionality) to our code projects.

## Markdown

With Markdown, you can format plain text to look like headings, links, images, and more!

<details markdown="block">

```markdown
# Heading 1

## Heading 2

...

##### Heading 5

###### Heading 6

This is a paragraph.

[link text](https://example.com)

1. Numbered list 1
2. Numbered list 2
```

#### Commit = Save

When finished, scroll down to **commit** your changes. In the **git** code management tool (used by GitHub), a "commit" is a savepoint. Commits require brief messages that describe what changes were made.
